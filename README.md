I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. I am broadly interested in international and comparative political economy, environmental policymaking, and state-business relationships. Regionally, I focus on Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia. My research examines the political conditions under which companies implement changes in their business practices on the ground, using quantitative and qualitative methods.
I hold a BA in Political Science from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
