I am a PhD student in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. I specialize in international and comparative political economy, with a focus on environmental regulations, transnational governance, and state-business relationships. My dissertation examines the political environment of voluntary sustainability standards (VSS), using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
I hold a BA in Political Science from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and an MA (en route to PhD) in Government from Georgetown University. I use he/him/his pronouns.
