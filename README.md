I am Keeheon Lee, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Government at Georgetown University (Washington, DC, USA). My research interests lie on the nexus of international and comparative political economy.
Specifically, I am interested in natural resource and environmental politics, the political environment of business operations, and Southeast Asian politics.
