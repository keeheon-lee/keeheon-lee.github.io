I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. I specialize in international and comparative political economy, with a focus on corporate regulations, transnational governance, state-business relationship, and energy/environmental politics. Regionally, I focus on Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia.

My dissertation project examines firm-level responses to the nexus of public and private regulations, using both quantitative and qualitative methods and Indonesia's palm oil industry as the main case study. 

I hold a B.A. degree in Political Science from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and an M.A. degree (en route to PhD) in Government from Georgetown University.
